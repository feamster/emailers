Panel 2: Congestion and Interconnection

Discussion questions:
• What is the current state of Internet congestion? What are the main mysteries surrounding Internet congestion today?
• What tools do we have to identify and locate Internet congestion? Are they adequate?
• Where is congestion? In the transit networks, at the interconnects, in the last-mile, or in the “last ten feet”?
• What mechanisms do we have (economic, technical, or political) to manage and mitigate Internet congestion?

Panel 3: Pricing Interconnection

Discussion questions:
• What are the different ways of pricing Internet congestion?
• What are the effects of data caps, pay-as-you-go pricing on Internet use?

In addition to these questions, our panelists will discuss open questions and future directions surrounding Internet interconnection.
