We are also hosting a smaller workshop before the conference on October
7-8, 2015, at CITP on the Princeton Campus.  The focus of this smaller
event will be to spend time designing and developing tools for
characterizing censorship.  We have restricted the invitation list to
this smaller workshop to researchers and developers who are actively
working on censorship measurement tools (e.g., OONI, Centinel,
Satellite).  We plan to allocate time for development, but our goal is
also to foster some common discussions and community.
