Dear @FIRST@,

We very much regret that due to a variety of circumstances, we find
it necessary to cancel the proposed QoE workshop we had announced for
February 2-3. 

A confluence of scheduling, planning, and budgeting issues
conspire to make this step necessary.  We hope to arrange a further
meeting of some sort on this topic in the future, but the February
meeting will not happen.  Apologies for this action.

David, Nick, and Fabian
