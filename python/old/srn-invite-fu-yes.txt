Dear @FIRST@,

We are looking forward to your attendance at next month's Self-Running Networks
workshop in Princeton!  

Two quick immediate points:

1. As a reminder, the room block expired two days ago, so if you have not
already, please call the Nassau Inn ASAP to reserve your hotel room. Details
from the original invitation email are copied below.

2. Note that to accommodate possible Valentine's Day plans and subsequent
travel, we will start with official programming at 10:30a on February 15. There
will be a breakfast that precedes the official start, but we figured that the
10:30a start on Thursday would give some flexibility, particularly if you have
not yet made your hotel booking (which you should do immediately, if you have
not done so!).

Looking forward to seeing you next month.

Best,
-Nick and Jen
