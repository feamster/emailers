Dear @FIRST@,

We would like to invite you to the second NSF/FCC workshop on tracking quality
of experience in the Internet.

In the first meeting, we discussed a range of issues related to QoE.  The
final report of that workshop can be found at
http://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/component/attachments/download/695

Based on the outcome of that meeting, this second meeting will be focused
somewhat more narrowly on issues relevant to the network context--the
relationship between QoE and network design and performance.

The high-level goal is to answer two questions:

   - What are the critical design parameters of a network such that a
   	 particular class of application will achieve good QoE?

   - What measurements are useful and appropriate in determining whether the
   	 network is impairing QoE?

If you are planning to attend, please register at the following site:

To expand the group, we would like to ask you for one or two names (and
contact information) of people you think should be included. The committee
will review the proposed names and send invite to as many of them as possible.

Thanks!
David, Fabian, and Nick
