As a reminder, we are having a small pre-conference workshop on October
7-8, as well, at Sherrerd Hall on the Princeton campus. The agenda for
these dates is forthcoming, but the rough plan is that we will have
10-15 people in attendance to discuss and work together on the current
state of affairs for measuring Internet censorship.
