Hi @FIRST@,

I wanted to congratulate you on your admission to Princeton! We’re very
excited at the possibility that you might come here.

I was hoping you might be interested in chatting about Princeton sometime in
the coming couple of weeks.

My current interests and research projects include: (1) security and privacy
in the Internet of Things (IoT), with a particular focus on smart homes; (2)
global measurement and circumvention of Internet censorship and information
control, from filtering to propaganda; (3) quality of experience on the
Internet (e.g., the performance of applications such as streaming video).

Many of these projects are just getting off the ground and seem like they
might dovetail with some of your interests. In many cases, other faculty in
the department are also interested in these topics, so there might be some
interesting opportunities to work with multiple faculty on some interesting
projects that cross disciplines from networking to systems to security and
privacy.

I hope that you’re planning to come to our visit day on March 8, we can also talk more there:

Congratulations again!  I’m very much looking forward to meeting you. Let me
know if you'd like to catch up in the coming couple of weeks, as well.

All the best,
-Nick
