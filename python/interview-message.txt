Dear @FIRST@,

My name is Nick Feamster. I'm a professor in the Computer Science department at
the University of Chicago. I also direct the Center for Data and Computing,
which is the university's intellectual hub for data science research on campus.

I work on applications of machine learning to computer networks, with a focus
on Internet performance, security, and privacy. Some topics I'm specifically
interested in these days include security and privacy in smart homes, Internet
censorship, and quality of experience of Internet applications (including video
streaming and gaming).  Most of my work involves the application of machine
learning and large-scale Internet measurement to these problems.
You can read more about me here: https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/.

I read your application to University of Chicago, and I'm interested 
in learning more about your research interests and plans for your Ph.D. I am
really excited by your past work and interests. 

I'm hoping we can find a time to chat sometime in the coming week.  Would you
have time? Let me know; I'm really looking forward to talking more with you!

Best, 
Nick Feamster
