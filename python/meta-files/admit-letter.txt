Dear @FIRST@,

Congratulations on your admission to Princeton! 

First of all, I wanted to personally extend my excitement about your
admission. The field was very competitive this year, so you should be really
proud of your achievements.

Second, I wanted to make sure you knew about (and hopefully are planning to
attend!) Princeton's Ph.D. student visit day, on March 10, 2016.  (There is
also a dinner the night before; details to follow.)

Finally, I wanted to offer to be a point of contact for any questions you might
have about the program, research, or anything else you'd like to ask. I was
personally very impressed with your work, and I wanted to offer that I'm
available to chat anytime, in case you'd like to talk about research
possibilities before, during, or after the visit day, as you think about the
next steps in your career.

Once again, congratulations!

All the best,
-Nick
