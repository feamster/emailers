We would like to invite you to speak on a panel.  A possible topic we have
identified for your panel is @TOPIC@, but we may adjust this topic
depending on the availability of panelists.

A tentative list of topics and questions is below, but of course as a
panelist, you should feel free to shape the discussion and topic to your
expertise and taste.

We have a limited budget to support travel for speakers and panelists,
if you need financial support to attend.
