Hi @NAME@,                          

For CoC Research Day (next Friday, September 25, in Klaus 1116) to be a
success, we are counting on every faculty member to participate...  The
inclusion of your work in this event is valuable to us!  This will also
be valuable exposure for your work and your students, both within the
College and externally, to alumni and others.

We haven't seen any contributions from your students yet - could you
please ask your students or postdocs to present at least a few posters
(5 is the limit per faculty member) and any demos you might have, and
give one or more talks?  Or, if you are not planning to participate for
some reason, we would appreciate it if you would let us know.

As a reminder, the login information for students is:

Thanks!
Nick and Alex
