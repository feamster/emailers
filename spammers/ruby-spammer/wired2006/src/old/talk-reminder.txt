Hi @NAME@,

We're sending you a friendly reminder that WIRED position statements
were due on September 1.  See http://wired2006.org/ for a reminder
of the workshop that you're planning to attend. :) 

We would like to have your statement as soon as possible so that we can
start posting the position statements to the Web page and get people
discussing the position statements and workshop topics early.  For
examples of statements from the previous version of this workshop, see:
http://www.net.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/wired/position/

Expect more details soon, including an attendee mailing list, where we
can discuss some of these statements, etc.

Thanks,
Nick, Tim, Jen, and Randy
