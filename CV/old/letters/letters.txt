Thank you again for agreeing to write me a reference letter in support of my
faculty application.  I sent off most of my applications today.

I've compiled a list of schools where I am applying, and whether they expect
to receive reference letters, at:

http://ginseng.lcs.mit.edu/search/letters.cgi

For the schools that expect reference letters to be sent by postal mail, I have
mailed self-addressed, stamped envelopes to you this afternoon.  Please let me
know if they don't arrive in the next few days.

The page also has a link to my application materials, which you can find at:
http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/~feamster/application/

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need more
information or help with anything.  I will keep you posted with any news I
hear and let you know if anything changes.

-Nick
