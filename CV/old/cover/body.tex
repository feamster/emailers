I am writing to apply for a tenure-track position as an assistant
professor in your department.  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with Professor Hari
Balakrishnan, and I expect to graduate in the coming year.

My research spans many aspects of networked computer systems, including
Internet routing and measurement, network security, and adaptive network
protocols.  I am specifically interested in the design and
implementation of robust networked systems, network security, and
network measurement and fault diagnosis.  My work applies practical and
theoretical techniques to design, build, and improve real networked
computer systems. My research has included the design and implementation of
several systems that network operators use in practice today.

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae, a list of references, research and
teaching statements, and four representative publications.  For your
convenience, I have also made these materials available online at
\url{http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/~feamster/application/}. 

Thank you very much for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you.
