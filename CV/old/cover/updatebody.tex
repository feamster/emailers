I have included two pieces of supplementary material for my application.
The first is a revised draft of my paper, {\em Detecting BGP
Configuration Faults with Static Analysis}, which recently won the best
paper award at the {\em 2nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design
and Implementation}.  Second, is a new paper on stable Internet routing
that I have just finished writing.  Please add these to my application
folder.  Thank you very much.

For your convenience, I have also made these materials available online
at \url{http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/~feamster/application/}.
