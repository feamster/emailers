Dear @NAME@,

We wanted to provide a brief update about the bus transportation to and from
the wedding venue.

The bus will leave for the Wedding venue at 1:30pm on Saturday from Marshini’s
mum’s house. The address is: 34 Woodford Avenue, Camps Bay, 8040. 

The bus will return to Marshini's mum's house at midnight or whenever the
reception ends, whichever is earlier.

Directions: If you are entering Camps Bay on the Camps Bay Drive road that hugs
the top of Table Mountain, follow this road for some time. You will pass Dal
road on your right, then Geneva Drive on your right. The third right turn is
Woodford. Marshini’s mum's house is the second house on the left with a white
wall and black gate. Please park lower down the street on the left hand side.


See you soon!

Love,
Marsh and Nick
