Dear @NAME@,

It is our pleasure to invite you to serve on the program committee for
the SIGCOMM 2013 poster/demo sessions. The poster and demo sessions will
be held in Hong Kong, during SIGCOMM 2013. More details are available at
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2013/posters.php and
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2013/demos.php.

Authors of posters will submit a 2-page abstract and of demos a 3-page
abstract. Hence, we expect the reviewing responsibilities to be quite
light. Last year, each PC member got 12 reviews and most did them all
in
a single day. There will be no TPC meeting. To help you in your
decision
here are the important dates:

Abstract Submission: May 17
Reviews due: May 31
Author Notification: June 1


If you're interested in being on the TPC, please let us know within the
next week. Thanks for helping us with this.

Thanks,
Nick Feamster
