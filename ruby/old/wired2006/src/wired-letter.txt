Dear @NAME@,

We---Nick Feamster, Tim Griffin, Jennifer Rexford, and Randy Bush---
invite you to the second Workshop on Internet Routing Evolution and
Design (WIRED).  The event is planned as a follow-on of the first WIRED
workshop in 2003.  The invitational workshop, of about 30 researchers,
operators, and vendors, will be held at Georgia Tech's Technology Square in
midtown Atlanta.  Please let us know by September 15, 2006 if you can join us.  
We certainly hope you can make it.

Regards,
Nick, Tim, Jennifer, and Randy

       Workshop on Internet Routing Evolution and Design (WIRED)
			   October 16-17, 2006
            Georgia Tech Technology Square Research Building
			 <http://wired2006.org/>

The Internet routing infrastructure has gained importance over the past
few years as the Internet is increasingly becoming a component of our
critical communications infrastructure.  Despite the importance of Internet
routing, we have not reached consensus on the design of an Internet routing
system that is easy to manage, control, and secure, yet still scales well and
provides good performance guarantees to end hosts.

Researchers and practitioners have identified various problems with
today's Internet routing protocols including, but not limited to, the
following areas:
	- Scaling (e.g., AS number and prefix exhaustion)
	- Security (e.g., route hijacking, data diversion)
	- Automation (e.g., generation of topology and configuration)
	- Correctness (e.g., misconfiguration, contract violations)
	- Traffic Engineering
	- Performance

The current Internet routing infrastructure was not designed with many
of these goals in mind, and solutions to these problems has become more
challenging - and crucial - as users demand more availability and better
performance from Internet-based services.  Solving the problems above
requires a unique combination operational expertise and a willingness to
consider longer-term solutions.  In light of these trends, we'd like to
invite you to participate in a workshop on the subject of Internet
routing.

Our goals are to:

	- Convene a focused group of researchers and practitioners who
	  are concerned with, or working on, Internet routing

	- Gain a better understanding of how the Internet's routing
          protocols are used in practice and the problems operators face
          with the current Internet routing infrastructure

	- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the existing
	  protocols, and identify aspects of today's protocols that
	  should be improved

	- Create a "wish-list" of important research problems, network
	  management tools, measurement techniques, and router features

This workshop is planned as a by-invitation event involving
  * A five-minute "position statement" presentation by each attendee
  * A collection of "debates" on specific Internet routing topics
  * Ample time for informal discussion and socializing

The outcome of the workshop will be a report that summarizes the
position statements of each attendee (and ensuing discussions) and
general discussion.

Attendees are expected to:
  * Write a 1-2 page position statement on key routing issues for the
    next ten years, in advance of the workshop (these write-ups will be
    made available on the Web before the meeting)
  * Prepare a five-minute talk summarizing the position statement, for
    presentation at the workshop (these talks will serve as provocative
    "Introductions" at the beginning of the workshop)
  * Agree to participate in a debate on a specific Internet routing
    topic of interest (e.g., soBGP vs. S-BGP vs. some other proposal).
    The panel topics and assignments will be hashed out via e-mail prior
    to the event, but they are likely to center around the five broad
    areas listed above.

The logistics for the workshop are as follows:

  * Key dates:
      - workshop:              2006 October 16-17
      - due date to RSVP:      2005 September 15
