Dear @NAME@,

We’re in the midst of wedding planning mania for the big day on December
17, 2011, and we’re really hoping that you can join us for the
celebration.  We know many of you have already replied, but, for those
of you who haven’t, the deadline to RSVP is coming up soon.  If you
haven’t already replied, or if you’ve changed your mind, RSVP on the Web
site **by May 31**: 
http://marshandnick.us/RSVP.html

If you can't reply via the Web site, please email or call us.

Also, as a reminder, our wedding Web site has all sorts of travel
information about the wedding itself including the proposed
schedule. We’ll keep it as up to date as possible and fill in details as
we finalize them.  You can get to our Web site here:

We want to stress a few important things:

    * If you are coming, you should reserve a car *now*.  It’s tourist
      season in Cape Town, and we have had the experience of not being
      able to get a car from any company in the city because of the
      increased demand during this period.

    * You don't need to pay up front for the car, but you should make
      the reservation now. Most car rental companies just need the dates
      you’re coming and the type of car you want, but that reservation
      could make the difference between having a car or not!

    * We’ll post accommodation information soon.  We recommend that you
      stay in Franschhoek on the night of the wedding to avoid the drive
      back afterwards (45 minutes).  For the other nights if you’re
      joining us for the pre-wedding ceremonies, we recommend staying in
      Cape Town.  *The pre-wedding ceremonies will be held in Camps Bay
      and Oranjezicht, both are areas in the “City Bowl”. Good areas to
      stay in Cape Town that are close to these venues include: Camps
      Bay, Seapoint, Tamboerskloof, Gardens, Oranjezicht, Mouille Point,
      or by the Waterfront.

Thanks! We look forward to seeing you in December!  As always, feel free
to drop us an email or give us a call on +1 857 272 1408 (Marsh) or +1
617 388 7479 (Nick).

With much love,
Marsh and Nick
