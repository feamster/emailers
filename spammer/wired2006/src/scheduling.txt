Hi Folks,

More details will be going up on the Web site soon, but to allow you to
buy plane tickets, we wanted to let you know the rough schedule:

WIRED will start with a breakfast at 9am, but the "official" program
will not start until 10am.  This scheduling should allow people on the
east coast to fly in that morning if they choose (e.g., the 6am flight
from Boston arrives at 8:56am, the 6:05 am flight from EWR arrives at 8:30am
etc.).

WIRED will end at about 3pm on Tuesday to allow folks to catch 5pm
flights on Tuesday.  

If you are coming and going at these "rush" times, you will almost
certainly want to take MARTA:

The closest stop to the Holiday Inn Express is North Avenue:

From the subway, it is aabout 0.6 miles walk to the hotel:

It is about the same distance walk to the workshop site at the
Technology Square Research Building:

though the hotel will be providing a shuttle to the workshop site.

If you are arriving the morning of the workshop, it is a very short walk
from the subway to the workshop site:
