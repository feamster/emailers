Hi @NAME@,

You may know that every year, I teach a course on Coursera in Software
Defined Networking (http://coursera.org/courses/sdn).  As part of the
course, I generally invite luminaries and leaders in the field of SDN to
share their experiences on a topic of their expertise.

I am wondering if you would be willing to do an interview with me for
the course over a Google On-Air Hangout.  We can talk about a topic of
your choice, but I was thinking of gearing the interview towards
@TOPIC@.

Hereâ€™s an example of one that I did with a lead Open Daylight developer
last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8jT_yewcw

The interviews generally last about 30 minutes, although we don't need
to keep a strict timeline.  I generally send out a list of questions
beforehand so that you can prepare a bit in advance.  The interview is
recorded and made available to the students in the course (this year,
about 35,000 students are enrolled, although only about 4,000 actively
participate/watch the videos).  With your permission, I also make the
video available on YouTube (although I am happy to restrict or remove it
if you prefer that).

Could you please let me know if you are available to participate in an
interview sometime in the next 2-3 weeks, and if so, what times might be
good? 

Thanks so much for considering doing this!
-Nick
