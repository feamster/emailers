Dear @NAME@,

Here are your grades for each of the assignments, and your projected final grade.

1. Please inform us if you see any discrepancies or things we may have missed. 

2. Please feel free to turn in PS 4 for extra points by midnight Sunday.  We
have already notified you if you are on a boundary and we think that turning in
the problem set will help you, but if you have questions about this, please do
not hesitate to ask us.  You can turn in parts of PS 4 for partial credit.

3. As mentioned on Piazza, we have made every effort to curve up scores where
possible.  The point weights are as given on the syllabus, and we have also
already taken care to move some "boundary cases" up to a higher grade if we
perceive that to be appropriate. More on grades is available from an earlier
post, here: https://piazza.com/class#spring2013/cs3251a/109

4. Please remember CIOS. :-)

@GRADES@

Thanks again for taking the course.  We really enjoyed having all of you in the
course, we hoped you learned a lot, and we hope to see many of you around!

Happy summer,
Nick
