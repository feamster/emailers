Dear @NAME@,

It is our pleasure to invite you to serve on the program committee for the
SIGCOMM 2009 poster/demo sessions. The poster and demo sessions will be held in
Barcelona, during SIGCOMM 2009. More details are available at:
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/posters.php and
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/demos.php.

Authors of posters will submit a 2-page abstract; authors of demos will submit
a 3-page abstract. Hence, we expect the reviewing responsibilities to be quite
light. Last year, each PC member got 12 reviews, and most did them all in a
single day. There will be no TPC meeting. To help you with your decision, here
are the important dates:

Abstract Submission: May 4
Reviews due: May 25
Author Notification: June 1
Camera Ready: June 15

If you would like to be on the TPC, please let us know by January 12.
Thanks for helping us with this.

Nick Feamster and Renata Teixeira 
SIGCOMM 2009 Poster/Demo Co-Chairs
