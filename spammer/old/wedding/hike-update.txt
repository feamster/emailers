Hi Everyone,

For the hike, we will meet at the hike trailhead for Platteklip Gorge,
close to the bottom of the cable car up Table Mountain.

Tomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m., we are leading a hike up Platteklip Gorge of
Table Mountain, led by Nick.  This jaunt can take up to 2.5 hours for the
average fit person. Those who do not want to make the hike down can take the
cable car down to make it shorter.  Some people may opt to take the cable car
up, as well. Here is some information on the hike:

The starting point and route:
http://connect.garmin.com/activity/53280216


- The starting point is about 0.75 miles past the cable car, on the right side of Tafelberg Road.
- The hike is about 2 miles up.  From the top, you can proceed dow via hiking or the cable car.

Things to bring:
- Good cap or sun hat
- Sunscreen
- Lots of water, probably 2 L per person at minimum since it gets very hot
- Few snacks (trail mix, granola bars, fruit, or sandwich)
- Comfortable walking shoes (running shoes, tennis shoes, hiking shoes if you have them)
- Shorts and t-shirt or cool summer clothes
- Warm top for the top of the mountain in case it's chilly

The hike is pretty convenient and will have lots of folks on it but it gives
good views of Cape Town and is a great workout. It is pretty steep stairs all
the way up but once you've made it, you can say you conquered the Table
Mountain!  The cable car ticket costs ZAR 100 to come back down. Check out
prices here. http://tablemountain.net/ If there's enough interest and folks who
want to go up without hiking, we can plan a party led by Marsh to go up via the
cable car. Also, online tickets are slightly cheaper even for returns for
Adults and Children (4-17 years) so we may want to purchase tickets ahead of
time on the web.  What you would need to hike:

See you tomorrow!
