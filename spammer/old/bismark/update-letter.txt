Dear @NAME@,

Good news!  We are ready to ship the latest release of BISmark routers.  

Please fill out the following form to indicate the following:
	* Your current mailing address
	* Your interest in still receiving a BISmark router 
	* Your agreement to participate

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDdOdExIS3J4V3N5bFhjSjh0YWxja0E6MQ

When you receive your router, you'll be able to plug it in and see continual
performance information about your ISP.  For example, by going to
http://networkdaskboard.org/devices/
and entering the MAC address of your device (e.g., mine is "C43DC7B0AE78"),
you'll be able to see statistics about upstream and downstream throughput, as
well as latency.

(Yes, we know the interface is still a bit primitive, but it is functional.  We
are working on making it a bit more user-friendly.)

Thanks very much for your patience as we prepare for this release!

-Nick
