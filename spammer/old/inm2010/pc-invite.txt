Dear @NAME@,

The Fourth ACM Workshop on Internet Network Management (INM'10)
will be held in conjunction with the NSDI conference in San Jose, USA 
in the end of April 2010.  As the technical program co-chairs for the 
workshop, we would like to invite you to serve on the technical 
program committee. We would be delighted if you accept our invitation. 

The TPC is critical for ensuring a high quality program, and building
on the success of the prior editions of the workshop. 
Your contribution to this mission will be 
greatly appreciated, including encouraging high-quality submissions 
(including submitting your own work) and providing thorough reviews. 


The previous editions have been held in conjunction with SIGCOMM (2006,2007),
and ICNP (2008). For ease of reference, here are some links to past years'
workshops:

This year, we hope to continue with a similar thread of topics, but also
expand the scope to include topics like Data Center Networking, and
programmable routers.

 
A tentative timeline is as follows:

 Paper submission - early December
 Acceptance -  late Feburary
 Camera ready - early April

You will be expected to handle 5-7 papers.
We expect to hold an TPC meeting through a teleconference - no
travel is required.

Please let us know your decision before July 24, 2009.
We hope you will accept this invitation. 


Thanks, 
 
Nick Feamster, Sanjay Rao
