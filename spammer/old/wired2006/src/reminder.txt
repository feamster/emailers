@NAME@,

We've still not received your position statement, and WIRED is next
week.  We are trying to organize position statements into sessions for
discussion topics, but it is difficult for us to do this properly
without your statement, which we asked for last month.

Please send us your statement as soon as possible.  Feel free to look at: 
http://wired2006.org/statements.html 
for existing topics and statements.

If you no longer plan to attend, can you please let us know so that we
can plan accordingly?  

Also, a reminder: you should also prepare a (roughly) 5-minute talk in
support of your position statement to help get discussion going.

Thanks,
Randy, Nick, Tim, and Jen
