Dear @NAME@,

Jeff Mogul and I are PC Co-Chairs for NSDI 2013, and we would be
thrilled if you would accept our invitation to serve on the Program
Committee.

We realize that the NSDI PC is a significant time commitment, but we
believe that your expertise and wisdom will contribute a lot to the
quality and impact of the NSDI 2013 program.  Many PC members have
found the process, while a lot of work, to be a rewarding and even
enjoyable experience.  

We really hope you will be able to accept our invitation.  Before you
decide, please read the detailed invitation letter below; it explains
what we will expect of each PC member.

We would appreciate receiving your response by *May 28*. Please let us
know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Jeff and Nick

The 10th annual USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and
Implementation, NSDI 2013, will be held in Lombard, IL (near Chicago),
April 3-5, 2013.  As the Program Co-Chairs for the conference, we
cordially invite you to serve on the Technical Program Committee.

NSDI is sponsored by USENIX in cooperation with ACM SIGCOMM and ACM
SIGOPS, and has developed a tradition as the source of top
networked-systems research.  The NSDI PC is the critical body for
maintaining the strong reputation of the conference.

This year we will continue the practice of having a uniform PC, where
all PC members have equal roles in reviewing, discussing, and deciding
upon papers.  We expect to have around 25 PC members and, with
approximately 175 submissions, we anticipate a review load of
approximately 28-30 reviews, split into two rounds.

Activities and Expectations
------------------------------------
Key aspects of the PC activities include:

1. A paper bidding process for all PC members, giving you a chance to
tell us which papers you prefer to review.
2. Round 1 of the review process lasting 5 weeks (~20 papers/person)
3. Round 2 of the review process lasting 3 weeks (~9 papers/person)
4. Probably one more paper in a short, third round.
5. An online discussion phase at the completion of each round.
6. A one-day PC meeting in Palo Alto, California.
  We expect *all* PC members to attend the meeting in person,
  barring unforeseeable events (illness, volcanoes, etc.)
7. Each PC member will shepherd one (or, in a few cases, two) of the
accepted papers. Shepherding a paper will include writing a short
"introduction"    for the paper, about 3 paragraphs, to be published in
the online proceedings.

We expect all PC members to review their assigned papers themselves,
without delegating to a colleague or student.  Of course, you can ask
other people to help you with aspects of your reviews.  To help us make
effective paper assignments, we will ask you to specify preferences for
papers after the paper title/abstract registration deadline.  We will do
our best to honor all preferences.  Note that NSDI reviewing is single
blind.

We realize that generating high-quality reviews of this many NSDI papers
represents a significant time commitment, and we will do our best to
minimize the impact on PC members -- which means, among other things,
that we will need all PC members to commit to delivering their
reviews on time, so as to avoid compressing the time available for the
other PC members (and the PC co-chairs) to perform the next phases of
reviewing.

To ensure that the PC makes the most informed decisions on paper
outcomes, we are requiring everyone to attend the PC meeting in person. 
If you have an exceptional and compelling reason for not attending the
meeting in person, please contact one of us to discuss your situation
before accepting this invitation.

Next Steps and Schedule
----------------------------------
In the near future, we will be drafting the Call For Papers, but for
now, you can assume that it will be fairly similar to previous NSDI
CFPs, such as
<https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi12/call-for-papers-0>.

Our tentative schedule for PC-related activities is:

Paper title/abstract submission:  Sept 12 2012 (20:00 PM PDT)
Paper submission:  Sept 19 (20:00 PM PDT)
Paper preferences due:  Sept 22, 2012
1st round papers assigned:  Sept 25, 2012 (or sooner)
1st round reviews due:  Oct 29, 2012 [a VERY firm deadline]
2nd round papers assigned:  Nov 1, 2012
2nd round reviews due:  Nov 19, 2012
One 3rd round review due:  Nov 28, 2012
PC meeting, in Palo Alto:  Dec 3, 2012
Acceptance notification:  Dec 10, 2012 or sooner
Camera-ready due:  ca. Feb 20, 2013

We expect to hold the PC meeting on Monday, December 3, at HP Labs in
Palo Alto.

We designed this schedule to avoid conflicts with other
networking-related events and with religious holidays, as far as we can
tell; please let us know if we missed something important.

We are looking forward to your positive reply by *June 12, 2012*.  If
you have any questions that could help you decide, please do not
hesitate to contact either or both of us (see below).  We are both
convinced that your contribution will help NSDI remain at the
forefront of networked-systems innovation, and we would be delighted if
you can accept our invitation -- provided you are willing and able to
commit to the workload.

Please send us a quick note (hopefully of acceptance) to both of us:
