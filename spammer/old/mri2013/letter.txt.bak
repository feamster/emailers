Hi @NAME@,

I hope you're doing well.

I'm in the process of preparing a National Science Foundation Major Research
Infrastructure proposal to build some large-scale measurement infrastructure
for the community---akin to PlanetLab, but for home and cellular networks. The
infrastructure will build off of our existing work on BISmark
(http://projectbismark.net/) and MySpeetTest (http://goo.gl/CrcnG) and will be
focused on supporting measurements for access networks, home wireless networks,
cellular networks, etc.  We are also partnering with some folks to enable
censorship measurements.

My vision is to develop infrastructure that will allow us to get some really
interesting and useful measurements from all corners of the Internet, from a
variety of devices and vantage points.  The infrastructure will build on the
work I mentioned above, but this is obviously a pretty ambitious effort, and a
big leap that will require quite a lot of effort and resources (and real
engineering effort), which is why I am reaching out to you for feedback.  I
want to make this something that we can all benefit from.  I strongly believe
that this could fill a real gap in our existing capabilities and knowledge.

I would really appreciate knowing if you would be interested in having access
to this type of infrastructure (or the data collected from it) and, if so, what
you would use it for. Filling out this form quickly (could take you as little
as 1-2 minutes) will really help me assess who might be interested in this
infrastucture and what features we might want to include in it.  If there are
others you think may be interested in this, please let me know, as well.

*If* this sounds interesting to you, would you mind filling out this form? (If
it's not interesting, of course, I won't be offended by silence :-)

Also, if you would be willing to sign (or write) a letter of support of this
infrastructure, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am happy to provide a draft
letter.

If you would like to read a one-page summary of the proposal, I can send it to
you immediately.  In any case, I would really value your feedback.

Thank you!
Nick

p.s. I have sent this note to about 20 other people in our community around the
world who have either worked on large-scale testbeds, home network/access
network measurement, or wireless.
