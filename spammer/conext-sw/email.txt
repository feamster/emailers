@NAME@,

We're writing to invite you to be on the Program Committee for the
CoNext Student Workshop 2006. The workshop will be held in Lisbon,
Portugal, during the first day of the CoNext conference (December 4,
2006).
 
The student workshop will consist primarily of poster presentations;
students will be required to send a short (1-2 page) abstract. We expect
to be quite inclusive about what papers get accepted, so the reviewing
load should be light.  We mostly expect you to go through the abstracts
and select those that are clear rejects. We do not need detailed reviews
from you.
 
If you're interested in being on the PC, please let us know within the
next week.  We will certainly appreciate your help (apologies to those
for whom this serves as a duplicate invitation because you already
received an informal invitation).  The relevant dates are below:

Submission: September 29, 2006
Reviews Due: October 10, 2006
Notification: October 13, 2006
Final Version: October 20, 2006

Because of the extremely tight schedule we are working with, it is
important that you submit your reviews on time.

Thanks,
Nick and Renata
