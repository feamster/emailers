Which of the following is true about content distribution networks?
\allapply
\setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item Content distribution networks can improve the
  performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between
  the client and the content that it is downloading.
\item Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a
  content provider by enabling much of the provider's content to be
  served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is
  within the client's own network.
\item Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby
  Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client
  to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
\item Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from
  a content distribution 
  network.  
\item All of the above.

Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control?
\allapply

\setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver
  by performing a ``carrier sense'' to determine whether any
  other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
\item Using RTS/CTS (``request to send'', ``clear to send'') control
  reduces the overall achieveable throughput of the wireless network.
\item Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver;
  such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
\item Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of
  the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver
  without RTS/CTS enabled.
\item All of the above.

Which of the following are true about video streaming?
\allapply

\setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays
  between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
\item Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video
  streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover
  from any packet loss in the video stream.
\item A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time
  to recover from lost packets.
\item Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the
  client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it
  does about receiving a high-quality stream.
\item All of the above.

\prob{4} 
Which of the following are true about TCP?
\allapply
\setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order
  stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
\item A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of
  unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
\item TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its
  sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
\item A TCP sender and receiver use a ``three-way handshake'' both to
  set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
\item All of the above.

Which of the following are true about the denial of service attacks (and
defenses) that we discussed in class?
\allapply
  \setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item In a ``SYN Flood'' attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim
  receives causes the to set up TCP connection state.
\item A ``DNS Reflection'' attack requires the attacking client to ``spoof''
  the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
\item If every network on the Internet performed stateless {\em ingress}
  filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection
  attack that we discussed in class would not work.
\item If every network on the Internet performed stateless {\em egress}
  filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS
  reflection attack that we discussed in class could not be carried out.
\item All of the above.

there are now more simultaneously active devices than available public

\prob{5} Suppose that, at a given time, a TCP sender has a congestion
window of 10 packets, that each packet is 1500 bytes, and that the

  numerically or graphically.  If you can't compute the rates in bytes
  per second, give the average window size for partial credit.)

  stream, and that the receiver wants to ensure ``smooth'' playout.
  What is the minimum amount of buffering that the client should have to
  ensure that the receiver can play out at the average rate, without
  interruption?  A numerical answer is better (show your work), but if
  you cannot figure out the math, you can give an answer graphically.

\section{Firewalls (+ Bonus Design Question)}

Suppose that Georgia Tech wants to only allow access to some of its Web
content for clients who are on campus.  (For example, Georgia Tech might
post a video stream that it wants to ensure is only visible on campus.)

To do so, it implements a stateless IP-based firewall that checks the
source IP address of the Web client making the HTTP request and sends a
TCP ``reset'' to any client whose source IP address is not inside of the
Georgia Tech network.

\prob{8} George Burdell is graduating next month and wants to continue
to be able to download this ``Georgia Tech only'' content, even after he
gets out.  He thinks that a carefully positioned Web proxy could help
him evade Georgia Tech's IP address-based filter.  Explain where George
should deploy his proxy, with respect to the client and the Web site,
and how the proxy could defeat the IP-based firewall.
