<h1>CS 3251: Computer Networking I</h1>


<div id="objectives">
  <h2>Objectives<a name="Objectives"></a></h2>

  <p>
Communications networks are fundamental to our everyday lives. Whether
    for enabling global scale commerce or connecting long lost friends,
    these systems have created an unparalleled age of
    information. Accordingly, knowledge of such systems is critical for
    all scientists and engineers. This course provides an overview of
    networking technologies. Students satisfactorily completing this
    course will gain the skills necessary to analyze and design
    networking systems and protocols. The course will begin with the
    application layer, looking at design patterns present in common
    application layer protocols. We then move down the network stack,
    considering topics such as reliable transmission and congestion
    control at the transport layer, routing at the network layer, and
    multiple access protocols at the link layer. After this discussion,
    the latter portion of the course will include wireless and mobile
    networks, queuing fundamentals, security, Quality of Service (QoS),
    and network management.

  <h2>Textbooks<a name="Textbooks"></a></h2>

<p>
There is one mandatory textbook for this
course: <a href="http://goo.gl/EPukV">James F. Kurose and 
Keith W. Ross, <em>Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach</em>, 6th
    ed.</a>.  You are welcome to use older versions of the textbook, but
you are repsonsbile for making certain that the assigned problems and
reading are the same as in the latest edition.

</p>

  <p>
Additionally, you will be expected to read about one paper a week, on average. (<a href="readinglist.html">Reading List</a>).<br />
    </p>

<div id="honor">
<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>
Students are expected to abide by the Georgia Tech Honor Code. Honest
and ethical behavior is expected at all times. All incidents of
suspected dishonesty will be reported to and handled by the office of
student affairs. You are to do all assignments yourself, unless
explicitly told otherwise. You may discuss the assignments with your
classmates, but you may not copy any solution (or part of a solution)
from a classmate.
</p>
</div>


<div id="pregrade"> <div id="Prerequisites"> 
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>  Some familiarity with both network
programming, programming in C, and scripting languages (<i>e.g.</i>, Perl, Ruby) will be 
helpful.  </p>
</div>

<div id="Grading">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
Grading will be based on three problem sets, two quizzes, and a
semester-long project with a presentation and writeup.  Participation
will count for "fudge factors".
</p>
<ul>
<li>25% 5 Problem Sets</li>
<li>20% 2 Programming Projects</li>
<li>25% Midterm</li>
<li>30% Final</li>
</ul>

Please try your best to turn in homework assignments and projects on
time. Each student is allowed a total of 4 "late days". Once you use up
the quota, no late homework assingment or project will be accepted. The
smallest granuality of time is a day, which means if a homework
assignment or project is late for an hour, it is considered as being
late for a day.
