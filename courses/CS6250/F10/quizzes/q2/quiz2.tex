{\em two} possible reasons why binary tomography might be inaccurate in

\begin{answer}
A simple example here would illustrate something as in the binary
tomography slides: For example, two end-to-end probes starting from the
same source but going to two different destinations.  If one end-to-end
probe succeeded, but the other failed, you would know that the failure
was on the link that corresponded to the failed probe, but not the
other.  (A picture here would be most illustrative.)

Binary tomography might be inaccurate in practice because failures might
be mistaken for congestion, or because measurements of the reachability
matrix may be inconsistent (e.g., due to re-routing during a failure
event). 
\end{answer}

One example of an intra-firewall inconsistency would be a rule that
denied all packets from a $/16$ subnet, but then a later rule in the
chain that allowed all packets from a $/24$ subnet contained inside of
that original $/16$ (any such subnetting inconsistency where the smaller
subnet contradicted the actions from the earlier subnet would be
acceptable here).

\begin{answer}
Two contiguous prefixes advertised by the same AS are 8.14.52.0/24 and
8.14.53.0/24.  One reason that an AS advertises two contiguous prefixes
would be for inbound traffic control for traffic engineering.  Two
overlapping IP prefixes advertised by the same AS are 8.14.0.0/19 and
8.14.0.0/24.  One reason that an AS might advertise two overlapping
prefixes is, again, for inbound traffic engineering.  Another possible
reason would be provider-based addressing (perhaps the AS has a
downstream customer that is advertising this prefix via both this
upstream AS, and another upstream).  This second answer should likely
only get half credit, since it is not quite feasible.  An AS that uses
AS path prepending is 53317.  AS path prepending could have had an effect
on the router that is directly upstream of this router, for example, so
it is not correct to say that AS path prepending did not have any
effect, even in this case.

  Also assume that the uplink speed is 1 Mega{\em bit} per second.
  Suppose also that buffering at the first hop is imposing the delay,
  and that no packets are dropped.  

  How large must the buffer on this first hop be, if packets are
  experiencing round-trip times of one second?
\item Why might access links use large buffers?
\item What is a disadvantage of using large buffers on the access link?
\end{list}
~\ansbelow
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
Latencies could vary over time due to congestion on the access link
introduced by the user's own traffic (either uploads or downloads could
cause buffering at the access link).  Latencies might also vary due to
congestion at otehr bottlenecks along the end-to-end path.

The buffer must be large enough to cause a one-second delay for some
packets on a 1 Mbps link.  So, that would be 1 Mbps times 1 second = 1
Mb.

Access links might use large buffers to help reduce packet loss.  The
disadvantage of such large buffering is that it can make it difficult to
use interactive applications, since large variances in latencies could
be introduced.  An interesting recent discussion of this phenomenon is
available here:

DNS has the smallest number of median packets per flow (one packet).
The flows are likely small for that protocol because most DNS lookups
can fit into a single packet.  ssh, on the other hand, has a larger
number of median packets per flow.  Flow sizes might be inaccurate,
particularly for ssh, because flow monitoring automatically ``dumps''
the flow records after (1) a period of ``silence'' (i.e., no packets);
(2) after a fixed period of time, on a regular basis (i.e., once every
30 minutes).  These can cause longer flows to be inadvertently broken up
into smaller flows.

\section{Design Question: Routing Security}

For this problem, consider the AS diagram shown below.  To indicate that
message $M$ is signed with the private key belonging to AS $i$, you may
use the notation $\{M\}_i$.

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{ases}


\prob{4} Suppose that AS $D$ advertises a route for IP prefix $y$ to
both AS $C$ and AS $E$.  Given equal local preference settings, AS $A$
would select the route through AS $E$.  Describe an attack that AS $B$
could mount to try to ``attract'' traffic destined for IP prefix $y$.  
\vspace*{1.5in}

~\ansbelow
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
AS $B$ could remove AS $C$ from the AS path that it advertises to AS $A$
for destination $x$, effectively having AS $A$ see two AS paths of equal
length---$AED$ and $ABD$.  If it treated routes from $B$ and $E$ with
equal local preference, there is some chance that AS $A$ might start
sending more traffic through AS $B$ as a result of this ``path
shortening'' attack. 
\end{answer}
}


\prob{4} Suppose now that these ASes all deploy Secure BGP (S-BGP).
Annotate the edges of the graph below to indicate {\em all} of the
signed route attestations that each AS advertises along with the route.
Use the notation recommended above: for example, $\{X Y Z\}_W$ would
indicate that AS $W$ signed the AS path $X Y Z$ with its private key.
{\em Hint: Be careful to sign the correct AS path; be careful to defend
  against route shortening attacks.}

\prob{5} George Burdell notes that, if a router should happen to reboot,
it would have to sign hundreds of thousands of routes before advertising
a full routing table to its neighbor AS, and the neighbor AS would have
to verify the signatures on all of these routes.  How might you design a
scheme to speed up the process of signing and verifying advertisements
for a full routing table's worth of route advertisements?  ({\em Hint:}
Think about some things that are common across routing advertisements.)
~\ansbelow
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
One possibility might be to have a {\em cache} of route signatures for each
route attestation.  You could, for example, cache the result of each
signed route attestation, since the AS paths for the routes coming from
a neighbor would likely be the same as they were before the reboot
occurred.  

One additional consideration with this approach is that caching old
signatures could make the router vulnerable to a replay attack.  So, a
more robust solution would be to also include a timestamp with the route
attestation, to prevent replay.  (In fact, S-BGP's route attestations
already include such a timestamp.)
\end{answer}
}

\prob{9} {\em Bonus.} George also notes that S-BGP provides no mechanism
for guaranteeing the authenticity of a BGP withdrawal message.  Design a
scheme that prevents at attacker from forging a BGP withdrawal message.
Your solution need not be cryptographic.  (Feel free to use
cryptography, of course, but you could take other approaches; for
example, you could use views of the Internet routing table from multiple
vantage points.)
~\ansbelow
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
One simple approach would be to have the neighbor AS sign the BGP
withdrawal messages, but that doesn't completely work, since the
neighbor AS could actually withdraw a prefix for a network that is
downstream.  Really, you would need a scheme that allows the AS to
determine {\em who initiated the withdrawal}, and that the {\em
  withdrawal was initiated by someone who has the right to initiate that
  withdrawal}.  There's actually no good answer to this, because anyone
could initiate the withdrawal of any prefix, for a variety of reasons
(\eg, an AS might withdraw a more specific route for traffic engineering
reasons).  

Two parts to the solution that should get credit are: (1)~recognizing
that a withdrawal could be originated from anywhere, not just the
immediate AS neighbor; (2)~somehow developing a scheme that attributes
the BGP withdrawal to a particular AS ({\em not only the neighbor}).
