\prob{5} Define the {\em end-to-end argument}.  Explain how TCP
congestion control abides by the end-to-end argument; explain the
potential drawbacks of individual routers enforcing congestion control
at each hop.~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.65in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1.25in}
\begin{answer}
The end-to-end argument says that the ``intelligence'' for network
functions (e.g., failure recovery, in-order delivery, encryption) should
be placed at network endpoints, not at nodes in the middle of the
network.  One rationale for this argument is that, if functions are
implemented inside the network, then functions may be unnecessarily
duplicated at each network hop.

For example, hop-by-hop congestion control may unnecessarily relieve
congestion at a hop along the path that is not the path's bottleneck.
Additionally, if each hop performs congestion control, end hosts may not
know to reduce their sending rates.
\end{answer}
}

\prob{4} Network operators use virtual LANs (VLANs) to divide a single,
flat layer two topology into many distinct domains, thus limiting the
scope of broadcast traffic (e.g., ARP queries).  Several data center
topologies that we read about (e.g., SEATTLE, Portland) instead use
lookup services to limit the scope of this type of traffic.  Do layer
two architectures like SEATTLE and Portland eliminate the need for VLANs
in data centers?  Why or why not?~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1.25in}
\begin{answer}
These layer two architectures do not necessarily eliminate the need for
VLANs in data centers.  In addition to reducing the extent and size of
each individual broadcast domain, VLANs can be used to separate
administrative domains for reasons such as security (e.g., to force all
traffic through a layer-3 firewall) or quality of service (e.g., to give
higher priority to one administrative group over another).

\prob{6} In Problem Set~1, you used the Click modular router to
implement a learning switch.  In this problem, you will use Click
elements to rate-limit HTTP traffic.  To do this problem, you will need
two new elements, described below:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Classifier}: This element takes {\em one input} and can have
  {\em n outputs}.  Processing is {\em push}.  The
  input is {\em offset/pattern}, where the offset is in bytes.  For
  example, 
\begin{quote}
Classifier(12/0800,
             -);
\end{quote}
sends IP packets to output 1, and all other packets to output 2.  (You
can add more patterns to this list, but you will only need two outputs
for this question.)
\item {\tt Shaper}: This element ``shapes'' traffic to a maximum rate.
  It takes one parameter, {\em rate}, which is the number of packets per
  second to shape the traffic to. This element's processing is {\em
    pull}. 
\end{itemize}
(1)~Draw a Click element pipeline that takes traffic from an interface,
    {\tt eth0}, shapes traffic {\em destined for the HTTP port} to a
    maximum of 1000 packets per second, and sends the rest of traffic
    unshaped; send your output to an interface {\tt eth1}; we have
    started the pipeline for you in a diagram below; (2)~Write the Click
    configuration corresponding to this pipeline.  {\em Hint:} The
    destination port offset is 42 bytes from the beginning of the

\prob{4} Explain the roles of the four ``D''s of the 4D network

(b)~dissemination; (c)~discovery; (d)~data planes?  Explain how the
IRSCP implements each of these four ``planes''.  (Your answer should be

\vspace{1.75in}

\sols{
\vspace{-1.25in}
\begin{answer}
The decision plane is the ``brains'' of the network.  It effectively
takes information such as the network topology and other parameters and
sets forwarding table entries in the routers to control the forwarding
behavior of the network devices.  In the IRSCP, the decision plane is
instantiated by a route control server that collects routing information
and makes routing decisions to achieve some high-level policy.  The
dissemination plane transfers information from the routers to the
decision plane---in the case of the IRSCP, iBGP serves as the
dissemination plane.  The discovery plane allows the decision plane to
learn about information such as the network topology---in the IRSCP, the
IGP is the decision plane.  The data plane forwards traffic; the IRSCP's
data plane is implemented with routers that forward IP traffic according
to the BGP routes that the decision plane installs.

\item Assuming 1500-byte packets and 10-nanosecond lookup speeds, at

\begin{answer}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{tries}
\end{center}
The two-level trie would take two memory accesses to find a prefix
match (20~ns); the four-level trie would take four (40~ns).  So, the
first trie would forward (on average) one packet every $2 \times
10^{-8}$ seconds, translating to $5 \times 10^7$ packets per second.
This translates to $1500$ bytes times $8$ bits times $5 \times 10^7
\approx 600$ Gigabits per second. \\
\\
The four-level trie would forward packets only half as fast on average,
translating to $2.5\times 10^8$ packets per second, or about $300$
Gigabits per second. \\

George Burdell observes that IP routing tables have grown excessively
over the last several years, and that one of the causes is that prefixes
must fall on power of two boundaries: ``If each IP address range could

boundaries, much less IP address space would be wasted.''

\item How would you test George's hypothesis?  (Hint: think about how you
  might scalably ``probe'' to determine whether addresses in the
  Internet's routing table were actually being used)
\item Sketch a rough design/approach for how you might execute a
  ``smallest range'' match for IP address ranges that are not a power of
  two.  (Your solution need not be efficient, but it should be correct!
  {\em Hint:} Also remember that you might have overlapping prefixes
  that are not strict subsets of one another.)
\end{list}
~\ansbelow
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
There are many plausible answers to this question.  One plausible way to
do this would be to create a {\em range} for each routing table address,
and search the routing table entries for any matching entries.  One
could then pick the matching entry with the shortest range. There could
be many possible ways to do this; one possibility might be to construct
a B-tree (as is done with database indexes of this kind).
