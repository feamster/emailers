\section{Congestion Control and Streaming}

\prob{20} 
In this problem, you will derive the relationship between TCP
throughput, round-trip time, and packet loss.  We'll do the derivation
step-by-step. You won't need to know any calculus, but you'll need to
use the formula for computing the area of a triangle: $\frac{1}{2}\cdot
b\cdot h$. Consider the TCP window evolution shown in the diagram below
for your answers.  

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{tcp-window}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the number of packets in the TCP window right after a
  packet loss occurs?
\item What is the number of packets in the TCP window right before a
  packet loss occurs?
\item What is the total number of packets transmitted in between packet
  losses, in terms of $W_m$.  ({\em Hint:} Remember that, with additive
  increase, the TCP sender's window will increase by one packet per
  round trip. The formula for computing the area of a triangle may be
  useful in answering this question.).  {\em Your answer here is
    equivalent to $1/p$, where $p$ is the packet loss rate, and the
    number of bytes transmitted in between packet loss events is your
    answer here times the packet size $S$.}
\item How much time occurs between each packet loss, in terms of $W_m$
  and the round trip time $R$?
\item Express the TCP throughput, $\lambda$, in terms of your answers to
  the previous two questions.  Your answer should be in terms of $W_m$,
  $R$, and $S$.
\item Use the relationship between $p$ and $W_m$ from part (C) to
  substitute into your equation for $\lambda$ to obtain an equation for
  $\lambda$ in terms of $S$, $R$, and $p$.

\end{answer}
}

\newpage
\prob{5} George Burdell notes that as the throughput of a link
increases, the sender's TCP sending rate becomes more erratic, since the
difference between $W_m$ and $\frac{W_m}{2}$ becomes greater.  (This
problem of TCP on ``large bandwidth-delay product links'' is a
well-known phenomenon.)  For applications such as audio and video
streaming, George notes that this behavior could result in poor
performance. 

Explain why a large ``sawtooth'' the results from a high bandwidth link
could result in poor streaming performance.
 
~\ansbelow
\vspace{2in}
\eprob


\prob{5} George proposes two different ways of
mitigating the effects of TCP senders with large bandwidth-delay
products:
\begin{itemize}
\item Measuring the round-trip time and loss rate on a link from the
  sender and adjusting the throughput of the sender based on the TCP
  throughput equation (which you derived in the previous question).
\item Increasing the buffer size on bottleneck links so that packets can
  be transmitted from the buffer while the sending rate is below the
  average rate of the link.
\end{itemize}
Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of each approach, in terms
of either implementing the method described, or in terms of how well it
is likely to help the performance of a streaming application.

\section{Web Performance}

\prob{15} 
Consider the {\em partial} ``waterfall'' diagram shown below, which shows a Firefox client's
process of loading the home page at \url{http://gatech.com/}.

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{http-waterfall}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many objects are being downloaded in parallel with the first
  object, the root document at \url{http://gatech.edu/} (the first row
  in the waterfall diagram?)
\item How many total DNS lookups are shown in the waterfall diagram?
\item Why is there not a DNS lookup for each object (\ie, why does each
  row in the waterfall diagram not show a TCP lookup)?
\item How many TCP connections appear to be operating in parallel to any
  single domain?  Justify your answer.
\item Why do rows 8--20 in the waterfall diagram not show TCP ``initial
  connections''? 
\end{enumerate}

\prob{15} 
The paper {\em Measuring and Mitigating Web Performance Bottlenecks in
  Broadband Access Networks} demonstrates that Web page load times stop
improving when the downstream throughput of the access link exceeds
about 16 Mbits/sec.  The paper claims that the latency of the connection
to the server becomes the primary bottleneck.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Give two steps in the process of retrieving a Web page where
  higher round-trip latency to the server can ultimately slow the
  overall page load time.
\item In class, we discussed how {\em increasing TCP's initial congestion
  window} could reduce the overall page load time.  Explain why.
\item We also discussed potential drawbacks of increasing TCP's initial
  congestion window.  List one drawback.
\item In class, we discussed how {\em prefetching certain parts of a Web
page load} could reduce the overall page load time.  Explain which
  aspects of a Web page load can be prefetched and how doing so can
  reduce page load time.
\item We also discussed potential drawbacks of prefetching.  List one drawback.
