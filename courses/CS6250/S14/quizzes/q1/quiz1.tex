neutrality is {\em not} enforced.  Describe one benefit to users, one

\newpage
\prob{8} A recent court ruling against the FCC suggested that although
ISPs did not need to remain neutral, they needed to be {\em
  transparent}, meaning that they would have to be clear about their
traffic prioritization and differential pricing policies.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item George Burdell wants to design a system to enforce transparency
  for ISPs in Atlanta.  He starts off by using a tool like {\tt iperf}
  (which you used in the assignments) to measure TCP throughput from his
  laptop at home to a server running in San Francisco.  He notices that
  the output of {\tt iperf} does not match the downstream throughput
  rate that his ISP advertises.  Ben Bitdiddle suggests that he should
  instead try using {\tt iperf} to a server that is located in Atlanta
  and he might see {\tt iperf} achieve a higher rate.  Is Ben right?
  Why or why not?
\item {\em Open-ended.} George begins sending traffic to the server in Atlanta and notices
  that {\tt iperf} {\em still} doesn't yield a throughput that is close
  to what his ISP advertises.  Ben suggests that other factors, such as
  George's laptop wireless card, the amount of load on his machine,
  ``cross traffic'' from other devices in his home, etc. may be
  interfering with George's measurement.  Help George make changes to
  his method that would better help isolate these effects.  {\em Hint:} You can
  consider collecting additional data, changing the vantage points that
  George is measuring to or from, and so forth.
