\section{Programming SDNs}

\prob{20} 
In this problem, you will explore a few simple programs in Pyretic and
PyResonance, applying what you learned in the lecture videos and problem
sets.  Consider the code sample below from the Pyretic examples, which performs simple MAC
learning: 

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}
def learn(self):

    def update_policy():
        self.policy = self.forward + self.query
    self.update_policy = update_policy

    def learn_new_MAC(pkt):
        self.forward = if_(match(dstmac=pkt['srcmac'],
                                switch=pkt['switch']),
                          fwd(pkt['inport']),
                          self.forward) 
        self.update_policy()

    def set_initial_state():
        self.query = packets(1,['srcmac','switch'])
        self.query.register_callback(learn_new_MAC)
        self.forward = self.flood  
        self.update_policy()

    self.flood = flood()           
    set_initial_state()


def mac_learner():
    return dynamic(learn)()

def main():
    return mac_learner()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain the meaning of the {\tt packets} statement (line 15).
\item Explain what line 4 does.
\item Explain why the {\tt match} statement on lines 8--9 matches on a
  the {\tt switch} field.
\item According to line 17, the initial {\tt self.forward} policy is
  {\tt flood()}.  Upon the first callback to {\tt learn\_new\_MAC}, {\tt
    self.forward} is reassigned.  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Explain when this callback takes place.
    \item Suppose that a packet with source MAC
      address {\tt ab:cd:ef:ab:cd:ef} arrives on input port {\tt 1} on
      switch {\tt A}.  Write the forwarding policy in terms of {\tt match},
      {\tt fwd}, and {\tt flood}, and explain how new packet arrivals cause
      the program to ``learn'' new forwarding behavior.

\prob{10} George Burdell wants to modify the learning switch to create a
firewall, as you have done in the assignments.  He adds the following
functions:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}
def firewall(self):

  def update_policy():
    self.policy = self.policy + self.query
  self.update_policy = update_policy

  def initialize():

    self.AddRule(1,'00:00:00:00:00:01')
    self.AddRule(1,'00:00:00:00:00:02')
    
    self.query = packets(None, ['srcmac'])
    self.query.register_callback(check_rules)

    self.policy = drop
    self.update_policy()

  def check_rules(pkt):
    filter_on_mac(pkt)

  def filter_on_mac(pkt):
    if self.CheckRule(pkt['switch'], pkt['srcmac']) == True:
        self.policy = passthrough
    else:
        self.policy = drop
    self.update_policy()

  initialize()

def main():
    return dynamic(firewall)() >> dynamic(learn)()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}
Assume that {\tt AddRule} adds a rule to firewall with ID {\tt 1} that
permits packets with the source MAC address provided, that {\tt
  CheckRule} checks for the presence of a permit rule at a switch for
frames with the corresponding source MAC address, and that {\tt learn}
implements a simple MAC learner.

\begin{enumerate}
\item George starts his control program and begins to send pings between
  host 1 and host 2.  The firewall passes traffic between these two
  hosts just fine.  However, when he sends pings between host 1 and host
  3, he notices that some traffic actually passes between these two
  hosts, even though there is no rule in the table for the host with MAC
  address 3.  Why?  
\item Briefly explain how you would fix the problem that George
  observes.  (You don't have to write any code to receive credit, although you are welcome to
  if it makes your answer more clear.)

\prob{10} In a common SDN control program, if a packet arrives at the
switch and the switch has no matching flow table entry for the packet,
the switch must send the packet to the controller.
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain why sending data packets to the controller is not
  desirable.
\item With advance knowledge of traffic
  patterns, it might be possible to avoid sending traffic to the
  controller.  Describe a mechanism for handling as much
  traffic as possible in the data path.  Mention possible scalability
  concerns with your approach, and possible ways to address them.

\section{Censorship}

\prob{10} 
Consider the figure below, which shows a Tor network, including a guard
node, a relay node, and an exit node.  

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{tor}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which of the links in the diagram are encrypted? 
\item Above each link in the diagram, write down the onion encryption for a
  Tor packet as it traverses the path from Alice to Bob, using the
  notation $\{M\}_{k_1}$ to indicate that the message $M$ is encrypted
  with the public key of node $1$.  You can (and should) use nested
  encryption.  
\item Explain how this mode of onion encryption makes it impossible for
  an intermediate relay in the Tor network to know either the sender or
  recipient of traffic.
\item Suppose that an attacker could observe traffic both entering and
  exiting the Tor network.  What types of attacks could an attacker
  mount, in this case?

George Burdell notes that, with knowledge of the Tor relays, a censor
