access link performed from the home gateway router that is directly
connected behind the DSL or cable modem? 
\allapply

\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item A single-threaded TCP throughput measurement should be able to
  accurately measure the full capacity of an access link that has high
  packet loss, if the size of the upload or download is large enough.
\item The router can monitor the network for other activity and only
  perform measurements when other network traffic is low.
\item Wireless interference inside the home may affect the performance
  measurements of the access link.
\item When DSL ``interleaving'' is applied to the access link,
  the latency to the first router in the upstream ISP's network
  should be equal to about the propagation delay of the packet.
\item All of the above.

\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
%\begin{enumerate}
\item Designers of data center networks often aim to address nodes in a
  ``flat'' layer two Ethernet topology to make it easier to migrate
  servers from one part of the network to another.
\item Layer two addressing cannot scale to the size of an entire data
  center because every switch must store forwarding table entries for
  every server in the network.
\item In PortLand, servers send broadcast ARP queries to discover the
  MAC address of a server with a certain IP address.
\item In VL2, servers send broadcast ARP queries to discover the MAC
  address of a server with a certain IP address.

In Problem Set~2, you studied the mechanics of traffic shaping.  {\em
  PowerBoost} is a feature advertised by cable ISPs such as
Comcast. Customers with PowerBoost enabled get a burst of traffic at a
rate higher than the service plan rate for a limited duration.  

Token bucket filters, such as the one you studied in Problem Set~2, are
commonly used to implement PowerBoost.  Each customer has a dedicated
token bucket filter that regulates traffic to that customer.  Consider a
Comcast customer whose connection is capable of a maximum rate of $20$
Mbits$/$s.

  PowerBoost. What is the configured token rate and bucket size?

\item The customer upgrades to a $12$ Mbits$/$s plan, with the
  capability for PowerBoost at line rate (20 Mbits/s).  PowerBoost rates
  apply for the first 10~MBytes (80~Mbits) of traffic. What is the
  duration of PowerBoost? What is the configured token rate and bucket

\section{Accelerating Web Performance}

George Burdell has been noticing that his Web performance to many
popular Web sites is slower than he would like.  For some sites, he's
noticed that download times can be more than half a second, even for
relatively small Web pages.  He has asked three of his friends to
compare download times to nine popular Web sites, as well.  The download
times in milliseconds are shown in the stacked bar plot below.  Each bar
represents one of the four users, and the total time can be computed by
adding the the
following mututally exclusive components:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=-1pt
\item {\em Lookup Time:} The time to resolve the DNS name for the site. 
\item {\em Connect Time:} The time to complete the TCP three-way handshake.
\item {\em Transfer Start Time:} The time until the first byte is received at
  the client.
\item {\em Transfer Time:} The time for the transfer to complete.
\end{itemize}

\prob{3} George notices that, in many cases, the
transfer time is not the only significant contributor to the overall
page load time.  He looks at this data and says: ``Upgrading to a higher
service plan would be a waste of money: Simply adding more throughput
isn't going to reduce some of the significant bottlenecks that are

George ``pings'' {\tt www.facebook.com} and notices that round-trip

Kilobyte, that the initial TCP congestion window for Facebook is $4$
packets, that the connection leaves TCP slow start and starts AIMD
congestion control when window size is $8$ packets, and that there is no
packet loss or buffering.  (Assume no parallel HTTP connections.)

\prob{5} How many roundtrips and how many milliseconds will it take
to download the Facebook page, excluding the time for the TCP 3-way
handshake and server setup time?  {\em Show your work.}

\prob{5} George says: ``30 milliseconds is really far away.  The
Facebook page would load much more quickly if I enabled a Web cache on
my home router, which is only 1 millisecond away.''  Suppose, for
simplicity, that half of the content on the Facebook page is cacheable,
so that 15 Kilobytes can be fetched from the home router cache (1
millisecond round trip) and 15 Kilobytes must be fetched from the
Facebook server (30 milliseconds round trip).  (Assume no
parallel HTTP connections.)
