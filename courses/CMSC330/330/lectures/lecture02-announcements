Lecture #2: week 2, lecture 1, Tuesday September 4

1. Webpage and ELMS

   We'll be using a class webpage for some information, and using the
   University's ELMS system to keep grades and post assignments.

   webpage URL: www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2012/cmsc330
   ELMS URL:    www.elms.umd.edu

   These are still not set up, but will be soon.

2. Syllabus

   The syllabus will be ready soon and will be on the webpage.  Students
   should read the syllabus carefully.

3. Lecture slides

   The slides from last time will be put on ELMS soon.

4. Ruby information

   Today we're going to start covering Ruby; sources of some information
   about it (besides the lecture slides) will be put on the class webpage.

5. Grace and TerpConnect account

   Programming will be done on the Grace cluster.  You will log into it
   using your directory ID and password (called your TerpConnect account).
   If you haven't used your TerpConnect account before, activate it now at
   www.oit.umd.edu/new.  Once it's activated you should be able to log onto
   the Grace cluster at grace.umd.edu (a cluster of Linux machines).

   Reminder- no electronic devices (cell phones, tablets, laptops) in class.
