Lecture #10: week 6, lecture 1, Tuesday October 2

1. Practice problems

   The next practice problem set, about automata transformations, has been
   posted.

2. Project #1

   It's due on Wednesday, but recall that any project can be submitted
   late, with a relatively mild late penalty.  Be sure to read the posted
   project grading policy, so you know how your projects are going to be
   graded.  It's three pages, we're not going to read it in class, but it's
   posted on the webpage available to be read.

   Emphasize that projects are individual work ONLY.  If you have trouble
   with something you can come to the TAs' office hours.

   Be sure to read the syllabus and project grading policy handout!!!!!

3. Lecture slides

   We'll get caught up with posting them soon.

4. Review

   Go back and emphasize why static types can be useful (catch type errors
   at compilation, when the programmer can fix them, rather than at
   runtime).
