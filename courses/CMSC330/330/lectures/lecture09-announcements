Lecture #9: week 5, lecture 2, Thursday September 27

1. Practice problems

   Practice problems about formal regular expressions and automata have been
   posted.

2. Quiz #2

   It'll be tomorrow.

   None of the past semesters' quizzes that we have are applicable, because
   we're covering material in a little different order than the course has
   done some times in the past, and we're also a little behind in lecture,
   so we didn't post any.  The practice problems are good preparation for
   the quiz.

3. Project #1

   Emphasize that projects are individual work ONLY.  If you have trouble
   with something you can come to the TAs' office hours.

   Recall that you can't ask or explain how to implement any part of the
   project via Piazza, although you're welcome to discuss things like the
   project requirements and Ruby language features.

4. Exam #1

   According to the syllabus, Exam #1 is two weeks from today, Thursday,
   October 11.  We'll talk more about how far the exam will cover (it's too
   early to tell), practice material, etc., next week.  For now just keep
   the exam on your radar.
