Lecture #19: week 10, lecture 2, Thursday November 1

1. Exam #2

   According to the syllabus it should be a week from Tuesday, Tuesday,
   November 13.  We'll have to see if the date should change slightly (to
   Thursday the 15th) as a result of the weather cancellation, and let you
   know next Tuesday.

   The project due date won't change in any case.

2. Practice problems about grammars

   They'll be posted after this lecture.
