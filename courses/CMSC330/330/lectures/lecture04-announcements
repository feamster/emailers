Lecture #4: week 3, lecture 1, Tuesday September 11

1. Webpage and ELMS

   The webpage is set up and the lecture slides so far are there.  You need:

   ID:       330student
   password: opensesame

2. Syllabus

   The syllabus will be ready soon (or maybe is already by now); read it
   carefully.

3. Next Tuesday

   Larry will not be on campus next Monday or Tuesday, and will not be
   reading email.  There will be lecture, taught by someone else (probably a
   TA).  If you need to talk to hom about anything don't send him email
   those days; talk to him on Wednesday when he returns.

   His office hours next Monday will be cancelled.

   If any of you aren't going to be on campus on Tuesday be sure to arrange
   ahead of time to get notes from a classmate who's going to be in lecture.

4. Project #1

   Look for it to be posted soon (when?  tomorrow or Thursday?  where?  on
   ELMS or on the webpage???)

   It will have information about how to set up your TerpConnect/Grace
   account.

5. Quiz #1

   Quiz #1 will be on Friday in discussion.

   Besides the lecture slides, sources of information about Ruby are on the
   class webpage under "Information", so you can read there if you want info
   beyond the lecture slides.

6. Practice problems

   We will make some practice problems available in some format (webpage?
   ELMS?) later today; these are in preparation for the quiz.  The solutions
   will also be posted, but don't just look at the questions and the
   answers- try to solve the problems yourself, or you won't get enough out
   of them.

7. Discussion section examples

   The examples from last Friday's discussion section are on the Grace
   machines in the directory

   /afs/glue/class/fall2012/cmsc/330/0101/public

   You can study them there.
