Lecture #2: week 2, lecture 2, Thursday September 6

1. Webpage and ELMS

   These are still not set up, but will be soon.  The lecture slides should
   be put on the webpage soon.

   You will need:

   ID:       330student
   password: opensesame

2. Syllabus

   The syllabus will be ready soon; read it carefully.

3. Piazza

   We'll be using it when the first project is assigned.  (For Larry's
   sections, most of the students haven't even been added yet.)

4. Ruby information

   Sources of some information about Ruby (besides the lecture slides) will
   be put on the class webpage.

5. Grace and TerpConnect account

   Programming will be done on the Grace cluster.  You will log into it
   using your directory ID and password (called your TerpConnect account).
   If you haven't used your TerpConnect account before, activate it now at
   www.oit.umd.edu/new.  Once it's activated you should be able to log onto
   the Grace cluster at grace.umd.edu (a cluster of Linux machines).

6. Illustrate concept from last time in irb

   Methods can be added to the Object class and called from any other class,
   but they have to be made public.  But they are also present, and can be
   called from, any other classes, since they're all subclasses of Object.

   Example in irb:

   def info(which, what)
     puts("#{which} is #{what}.")
   end

   public(:info)

   Object.methods

   info("rain", "wet")
   info("icecream", "yummy")

   s= String.new

   String.methods

   s.info("larry", "amazing")
