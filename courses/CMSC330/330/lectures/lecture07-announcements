Lecture #7: week 4, lecture 2, Thursday September 20

1. Larry

   Larry's office hours next Wednesday will be cancelled.

2. Office hours

   The schedule is on the class webpage and the office hours have started.

3. Project #1

   It should be posted tonight or tomorrow.

4. Practice problems

   Some practice problems about formal regular expressions have been
   posted now.

   Practice problems about automata (which we'll start covering today) will
   also be posted soon.

   The practice problems are very important, so work hard on them!  Don't
   just look at the questions and answers.

5. Formal r.e.'s

   Emphasize that the only formal r.e. operations are concatenation,
   alternation, and Kleene star.  All the other Ruby r.e. constructs, like
   +, ?, anchors, character classes, backreferences, abbreviations like \w,
   \s, \d, etc., are not allowed.
