Lecture #17: week 9, lecture 2, Thursday October 25

1. Exam #1

   They were returned in discussion last Friday.  If you weren't there you
   can pick up your exam during any of my scheduled office hours.

2. Project #3

   It's posted; start now.

3. The difference between fun and function in OCaml (for defining anonymous
   functions):

   Just for clarity:

   function allows  pattern matching (i.e. |), but consequently it
   can be passed only one argument:

     function a -> x | b -> y | c -> z

   is equivalent to

     fun exp -> match exp with a -> x | b -> y | c -> z

   fun does not allow pattern matching, but can be passed multiple
   arguments, e.g.

     fun x y -> x + y

4. Who was talking to me earlier in office hours today?
