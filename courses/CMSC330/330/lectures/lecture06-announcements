Lecture #6: week 4, lecture 1, Tuesday September 18

1. Larry

   Reminder that Larry is away from campus yesterday and today; he will
   return tomorrow.

2. Project #1

   If it's been posted already say so, otherwise just omit.

3. Office hours

   If they've started already say so, otherwise just omit.

4. Practice problems

   Some practice problems about formal regular expressions will be posted
   soon.

5. Correction/clarification

   Larry got himself confused about something lecture last time, perhaps due
   to rushing before the end, or perhaps because he is old and foolish
   (although he was foolish when young also).  Clarify/correct what the
   following concatentation of languages is:

   L emptyset (concatenating any language with the empty language)

   vs.

   L { emptystring }

   (Poor Larry managed to get himself discomboulated between the empty set
   and language consisting of the empty string, right after telling students
   not to become confused between these.)
