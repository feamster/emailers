Lecture #20: week 11, lecture 1, Tuesday November 6

1. Exam #2

   - Due to the weather cancellation Exam #2 will be next THURSDAY, November
     15, NOT next Tuesday the 13th.

   - I'm not sure how far it'll cover through; we'll have to see how far we
     get in class this week, and tell you as soon as we know.

   - Like before, we have some practice questions that we'll post soon (with
     solutions).  Don't just look at the questions or answers; you have to
     solve the problems.  If you have questions you're welcome to come to
     office hours.

   - The practice questions are NOT a guarantee of what your exam will look
     like; they're just a study aid to let you know what you know or what
     you might need to study more or ask questions about.

   - We'll also post some exams from recent semesters in this course, which
     are useful practice, but they were not written by this semester's
     instructors.  Since everyone writes exams and projects a little
     differently, the practice exams that we wrote are the best guide to the
     types of questions that you might see (as well as your quizzes this
     semester, and the posted practice problems).

   - As of when we post these things, we may not have covered all the
     material they ask about.  Just ignore anything that we don't cover
     before the exam.

2. Practice problems about grammars

   - They're posted.

   - We may have more practice questions about upcoming topics, depending on
     how fast things go.

3. Quiz #4

   - It'll be Friday.

   - Do the practice problems about grammars.

   - If we see that any of the prior semesters' quizzes look applicable
     we'll post them soon also.

   - Since the exam will be before you can get your quiz returned, for this
     quiz we'll post the questions and answers early next week.

4. Project #3

   - It's due today, but recall that any project can be submitted late, with
     a relatively mild late penalty.  Be sure to read the posted project
     grading policy, so you know how your projects are going to be graded.
     It's three pages, we're not going to read it in class, but it's posted
     on the webpage available to be read.

   - Projects are individual work ONLY.  If you have trouble with something
     you can come to the TAs' office hours.

5. Project #4

   Look for it in a couple of days.
