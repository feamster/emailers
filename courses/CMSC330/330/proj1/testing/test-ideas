All tests can test both valid and invalid things.  For example, in a test of
ints, 123abc should be an int followed by an ID, not a hexadecimal int.

1. Test ids.

2. Test keywords (and things that are similar but not keywords)

3. Test booleans (and things that are similar but not keywords)

4. Test decimal ints.

5. Test octal ints, including things like 058.

6. Test hexadecimal ints, including things like 0xabcdefghij.

7. Test floats without exponents (including single and double precision).

8. Test floats with exponents (including single and double precision).

9. Test chars, including escape sequences and quotes.

10. Test strings, including escape sequences and quotes.

11. Test operators.

12. Test comments (pick a simple input like one of the public tests, and add
    several comments, including one that is the entire line).

13. Test the longest match with mixtures of keywords and identifiers.

14. Test the longest match with mixtures of operators (for example, >>>,
    >>>>, >>>>>>, >>=>>>=, etc.)

15. A very difficult input with lots of confusing tokens next to each other.

16. A simple test (like one of the public tests) just not using -n.

17. A test using invalid command-line arguments, like -no, -m, etc. (which
    should be ignored).
