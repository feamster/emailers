      Final course grades have been submitted.  They are available (or will be
      after an unknown delay, depending upon how quickly the University updates
      things) from either Testudo, or MyUMD.  Please do not email the
      instructional staff asking what your grade is; just check Testudo or
      MyUMD later, as they will be available there.<br /><br />
      A few statistics about grades will be posted here in a day or two, so
      check back then if interested.

        <li> <span class="fnt0">Just FYI, the averages you see for coursework
            in the ELMS gradebook are not really accurate, because they include
            students who didn't do the coursework.  For example, the Quiz #5
            average shows as 29.75, but when you exclude the students who didn't
            show up to take the quiz, the real average is actually 34.8 (a very
            good result).  So in looking at the grade statistics, just keep in
            mind that the results on coursework are generally better than they
            appear.</span></li>
