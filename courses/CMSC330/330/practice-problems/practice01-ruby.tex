            \item Explain how goals for programming languages have changed
                  since the 1960â€™s.

            \item List two desirable attributes for a programming language
                  where Ruby is better than C.  Explain why.

            \item Give two methods for executing a program.  Which method is
                  used by Ruby?

          \end{enumerate}

            \item Write a Ruby method \texttt{printit} that takes an integer
                  as a parameter, and prints it.  Write a call to
                  \texttt{printit} with 2 as its argument.  Circle and label
                  the formal and actual parameters in your code.

            \item Using different Ruby control statements, write four
                  different code fragments that each iterate and print the
                  values between 1 and 10.

            \item Explain the difference between explicit and implicit
                  variable declarations.

            \item Give two advantages of static types.

            \item \sloppy Write a Ruby class \texttt{Teacher} that contains
                  an integer field \texttt{students} and an integer field
                  named \texttt{totalStudents} that is shared across all
                  objects of the class.  You don't have to write any methods
                  for the class. \fussy

            \item Give an example of shallow (reference) copy in Ruby.

            \item Give an example of testing for structural equality in
                  Ruby.

          \end{enumerate}

                  expression \texttt{/0\$/}.

                  expression \texttt{/\string\./}.

    \item Write a Ruby program that reads the name of a text file from the
          command line, opens the file, reads every line of text in the
          file, and prints only the lines that contain exclusively the
          following characters: uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and
          underscore.  For example, lines that contain any spaces or
          punctuation should not be printed.

    %               digits) encountered.  Each line of input may contain zero
