For simplicity each public test consists of a password file, a group file,
and a standard input file with login data, named publicN.passwd,
publicN.group, and publicN.input respectively, plus an expected output file
publicN.output.  Run your program for example on the first public test as

  proj2.rb public1.passwd public1.group < public1.input

Then compare your output to public1.output as illustrated in the project
assignment.

Since the password and group files are actually the same for all inputs (but
it may be easier to have a set of three distinct names for each public
test), they password and group files for the last three public tests are
actually just symlinks to the password and group file for the first public
test.
